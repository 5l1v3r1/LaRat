# LaRat
### Lightweight Android Remote Administration Tool
In the world of mobile phone security, Android is the leading platform in malware. There is no limit to the damage that can be caused to a phone, simply by installing an app. LaRat was built PURELY for demonstration of security flaws within Android. This project was built roughly in a week for a project in my Computer Ethics course at Montana State University and was not built for malicuous intentions!
